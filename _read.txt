Instructions for ARCPLOTS

In order to recreate the arcplots, users must ensure they have python >= 3.8
and R >= 4.0.3 installed and operational on their local machine. Jupyter Notebooks
are used often, so please install according to the following
instructions: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
To install python requirements: locate 'Requirements.txt', press 'Shift+right_click',
open command line, type: pip install -r (pasted path). Your final line should look like:
pip install -r "C:/some/path/to/Requirements.txt"

1) Open the python notebooks (.ipynb) titled "Build_xxxx_gml"
2) Run all cells in the notebook. This will create a xxxx.gml.txt file
   which contains the information needed for the R script.
3) Open the corresponding "xxxxArcplot.R" script in R studio.
4) ****You must now direct the script to your newly create .gml.txt file.
   Locate the new .gml.txt file, press "Shift+righ_click" and select 'copy
   as path.' Paste this into the R script in line 8.
   Line 8 should now read: mis_file = "C:/some/path/to/file.gml.txt"
   Make sure the path has all forward slashes, otherwise there may be an
   issue running the sctipt.
4) Run the script. If all packages are installed correctly, you will
   be provided with the output "xxxxArcplot" which can be exported as .svg.

Instructions for SANKEY 

In order to recreate the arcplots, users must ensure they have python >= 3.8
and R >= 4.0.3 installed and operational on their local machine. Jupyter Notebooks
are used often, so please install according to the following
instructions: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

1) Locate the 'Sankey.py' file.
2) "Shift+righ_click" and select 'copy as path.'
3) In your command line, type: python + (my pasted path)
4) Your terminal should now read: python "C:/some/path/to/sankey.py"
5) Press 'Enter' to run
6) This will save a 'sankey.png' and 'sankey.svg' in the same directory as the
   'sankey.py' file
7) ***Note: Since the sankey diagrams lists overlapping values, we have used a vector
   editing software to replace the text and numbers with the numbers returned in the terminal

Instructions for STACKEDBARS

In order to recreate the arcplots, users must ensure they have python >= 3.8
and R >= 4.0.3 installed and operational on their local machine. Jupyter Notebooks
are used often, so please install according to the following
instructions: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

1) Open the python notebooks (.ipynb) titled "xxxx_stacked_bar_chart.ipynb"
2) Run all cells in the notebook.
3) This will save a '.svg' copy of the files to the same directory as the '.ipynb'
   files.
